## Description
BrainFreq is a cutting-edge MERN stack single-page application showcasing collaborative problem-solving capabilities and exemplary full-stack development skills. The application leverages React for the frontend, GraphQL with a Node.js and Express.js server for the backend, and MongoDB with Mongoose ODM as the database. With user-friendly interactivity, data security, a polished UI, and robust functionality, BrainFreq serves as an ideal portfolio piece.

## User Story
AS A full-stack web developer
I WANT to build a MERN-stack single-page application
SO THAT I can demonstrate my coding abilities and collaborate to solve real-world challenges

## Acceptance Criteria
GIVEN a MERN-stack single-page application

WHEN I start building the application,
THEN I ensure the creation of a React front end, a Node.js and Express.js server handling API requests via GraphQL, and MongoDB with Mongoose ODM as the database.

WHEN I integrate user authentication,
THEN I use JWT for secure access and protect sensitive API key information on the server-side.

WHEN I design the application's appearance,
THEN I ensure it has a polished UI with professional CSS styling, is responsive, and provides a seamless user experience across various devices.

WHEN I program the application's interactivity,
THEN I make it responsive to user input, allowing data retrieval, addition, update, and deletion.

WHEN I complete the application,
THEN I deploy it on Heroku, create a comprehensive README, and ensure that the project repository adheres to quality coding standards.

WHEN I plan for future development,
THEN I consider implementing PWA functionality, including a web manifest for installation and app-like experience, and a service worker for offline functionality and performance improvement.

WHEN I present the project,
THEN I prepare a concise elevator pitch, explain the user story and motivation for development, highlight the technologies used, challenges faced, successes achieved, and present a live demo. I also discuss potential improvements and enhancements, provide links to the deployed application on Heroku and the GitHub repository, and document how to deploy with Heroku and MongoDB Atlas.
